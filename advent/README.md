# Advent

Repo for Phoenix App that contains Advent of Code Solutions for 2022.

Running it via docker-compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Or with an interactive iex shell

```
docker run --env ADVENT_SESSION_ID=$ADVENT_SESSION_ID -it advent-1 iex -S mix phx.server
```

Not sure how I'll structure the Solution context yet. Still need to make the results UI useful, but that can come when I have solution formats.

# Original Phoenix README Below: 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
